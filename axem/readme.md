We should create a json on yaml file to organize which docker image have to use to this project
Use name convention for docker images like: l_arm_gnu:v1.0.0 or l_stlink:v1.0.0

We should integrate the tool_dockerfiles repository scripts with that descriptor file to create an infrastructure init script.
